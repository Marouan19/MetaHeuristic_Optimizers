# Meta_Heuristic_Optimizers

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing various meta-heuristic optimization algorithms inspired by natural phenomena.

## Contents

1. `Black_Hole_Optimization.ipynb`: Implementation of the Black Hole Optimization algorithm
2. `Flying_Squirrel_Optimizer.ipynb`: Implementation of the Flying Squirrel Optimization algorithm
3. `Water_Cycle_Algorithm.ipynb`: Implementation of the Water Cycle Algorithm

## Overview

Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are a class of algorithms that draw inspiration from natural phenomena to solve complex optimization problems. This repository showcases three such algorithms:

1. **Black Hole Optimization**: Inspired by the behavior of black holes in space
2. **Flying Squirrel Optimizer**: Based on the gliding behavior and food searching strategies of flying squirrels
3. **Water Cycle Algorithm**: Mimics the water cycle process in nature

Each notebook contains the algorithm implementation, explanations, and example usage.

## Usage

To use these notebooks:

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed
3. Open the desired notebook and run the cells

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
